Pro Mod
Version 2.6
Website: http://promod.webege.com

Pro Mod is a configuration for Left 4 Dead 2 built for Confogl with the purpose of
making competitive play more balanced and interesting. It's the most recent set of
changes from an evolving set of ideas put forth from other configs such as Fresh
and Metafogl, as well as the community.

Installation Instructions (Must be done in ORDER)
=======================================================================================
Step 1 - Stop Server
Step 2 - Install Metamod: Source
Step 3 - Install Sourcemod
Step 4 - Install Stripper: Source
Step 5 - Install Confogl
Step 6 - Install SDK Hooks
Step 7 - Install Pro Mod
Step 8 - Start Server
=======================================================================================


-----------------[Step 1 - Stop Server]------------------------------------------------
Stop your server in the control panel of your GSP. Not doing this step sometimes causes
issues when installing.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


-----------------[Step 2 - Install Metamod: Source]------------------------------------
If you already have Metamod: Source installed, skip this step.

If you are using Nuclear Fallout, instead just install it on the Autoinstallers tab of
your control panel.

Download Metamod: Source. Determine which OS your server runs on and download that
version (if you are not sure ask your GSP). Extract the files to the same directory
structure of your server. After that, go to the metamod site and click Make your VDF
and choose Left 4 Dead 2. Download the metamod.vdf put it inside the "../addons/"
folder. Metamod: Source is now installed.

-----------------[Step 3 - Install Sourcemod]------------------------------------------
If you already have Sourcemod installed, skip this step.

If you are using Nuclear Fallout, instead just install it on the autoinstallers tab of
your control panel.

Download Sourcemod. As with step 2 determine which OS your server runs on and download
that version. Extract the files into the same directory structure of your server.
Sourcemod is now installed.

Download: http://www.sourcemod.net/downloads.php
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


-----------------[Step 4 - Install Stripper: Source]-----------------------------------
Download Stripper: Source from the official Pro Mod website. Make sure you download the
correct one for your OS (if unsure ask your GSP, for NFO it's probably Windows) and
make sure you use this one and NOT the one on bailopan.net or elsewhere! Extract the
files into the same directory structure of your server. Stripper: Source is now
installed.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


-----------------[Step 5 - Install Confogl]--------------------------------------------
Download the fixed confogl from the official Pro Mod website. MAKE SURE you get the one
on the Pro Mod website, the one on the google code page contains outdated files that
might cause conflicts. Extract all of the files into the same directory structure of
your server. Confogl is now installed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


-----------------[Step 6 - Install SDK Hooks]------------------------------------------
Download SDK Hooks from the Allied Modders forum. Make sure you download the correct
one for your server OS as previous tips suggest. Extract the files into the same
directory structure of your server. Look and make sure the following files DON'T exist
on your server in the sourcemod folder:

    gamedata/sdkhooks.games.txt
    extensions/sdkhooks.ext.dll
    extensions/sdkhooks.ext.so

If so, DELETE them. They are left overs of an outdated version of SDK Hooks and will
cause conflicts on your server. SDK Hooks is now installed.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


-----------------[Step 7 - Install Promod]---------------------------------------------
Download Pro Mod from the official Pro Mod website. Extract all of the files into the
same directory structure of your server and overwrite anything that it asks to. Promod
is now installed. If you intend to install additional configs such as Equilibrium, then
remember to remove any mapinfo.txt in the l4d2lib path and place it directly into the
directory of the config itself (see below). If you're installing Equilibrium 1.3 or
less make sure Pro Mod 2.6 plugins aren't overwritten by them as they are the latest.
Equilibrium 1.4 and greater (when released) will have no conflicts when overwriting
each other.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


-----------------[Step 8 - Start Server]-----------------------------------------------
Restart your server and connect to it. Once in game type in console "sm version" and
"meta version" to check if both are installed. Try to start a config with !match
whatever. To check plugins are loaded type "sm plugins" and then !resetmatch to see if
it correctly unloads then try another config. Your server is now installed, gg.

=======================================================================================
Additional Q/A
=======================================================================================

  ["Commands like !forcestart and !forcematch aren't working."]

  If everything else works, you probably need to set admins in sourcemod.
  See here: http://wiki.alliedmods.net/Adding_Admins_%28SourceMod%29


  ["I'm finding throwables, map distance issues, or tank are spawning in weird places."]

  Since Pro Mod 2.5, mapinfo.txt is read from each individual config directory instead of
  one static location. Make sure you place the mapinfo.txt of any additional configs you
  want to use such as EQ in their directory (ie, cfg/cfgogl/eq/mapinfo.txt) instead of
  in the old default (addons/sourcemod/configs/l4d2lib/) directory.


  ["How do I get other configs like EQ into the match vote menu?"]

  You must add them in (addons/sourcemod/configs/matchmodes.txt) and then add this
  line into the confogl_plugins.cfg file of the config you wish to add:

        sm plugins load match_vote.smx

  Additionally you may add the above line to your confogl_personalize.cfg so that it is
  universally loaded for all configs, but you must still edit matchmodes.txt. Both of
  the fixed confogl packages already have the plugin loading line added.


  ["SI sounds are off, I can hear SI spawns on survivor, or my teammates are invisible."]

  SMAC's wallhack plugin causes these issues as well as causes hit registration issues.
  I really don't recommend using it with Left 4 Dead 2.


  ["Where is zombie bat?"]

  Zombie bat lives in all of us.
